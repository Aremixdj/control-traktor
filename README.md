## renameSelectedTrack

* tap a tab on Mira (iPad)
* scroll between options on Push2

Name the track from a list of common options.

## resampleSelectedTrack

* tap a tab on Mira (iPad)
* map button on Push2 or other controller

When jamming with soft synths or hardware synths, MIDI notes are driving that synth. Recording into the instrument channel would therefore record the MIDI input rather than the audio output. When recorded MIDI is played back at a later date, the sound is often different to what was originally played, due to some combination of synth settings not being saved with the MIDI input (this is especially the case with hardware synths). In this instance it's better to capture the audio output rather than the MIDI input. For synths that don't have MIDI input, audio capture is the only choice.

On the Push2, creation of a track-based audio (or MIDI) resampling track necessitates multiple button presses and two hands. This interrupts the creative flow as it requires extensive hand-eye coordination:

1. Press 'Mix'
2. Press 'Mix'
3. Press to select 'Input & Output'
4. Scroll to select 'Input Type'
5. Press Record + Track Select
6. Rename new track in software
7. Recolour new track

Key/MIDI mapping RST's BEFORE and AFTER buttons automates this process:

1. RST inserts a new track BEFORE (to the left of) or AFTER (to the right of) the selected track
2. RST matches the type of the new track to the type of the selected track (Audio or MIDI)
3. RST sets the input of the new track to the name of the selected track
4. RST arms the new track
5. RST names the new track to indicate the source name and the time of creation
6. RST recolours the new track to match the source colour

Recording can now be started via a single button press on the desired clip slot.

Note: This patch is functionally similar to ClyphX Pro's `INSAUDIO`/`INSMIDI`.

## Insights

### Passing variables to the JavaScript file

#### Arguments

Patcher:

```txt
[live.tab] # UI object sending input to script
  | | |
    |
  [js script-name.js] # js object containing script (see list of tested variations below)
```

JS:

```js
function bang()
  if (jsarguments.length > 1) {
    post(jsarguments[0]); // script name
    post(jsarguments[1]); // first argument
  }
}
```

I couldn't figure out how to use a dynamic value with this approach, as when a value is sent into the `js` object's inlet,
it is treated as a function name rather than a string argument. That generates an error as there is no matching function.

> js: no function argName [script-name.js]

This error can be mitigated by adding an `anything()` function:

```js
function anything() {
  console.log(jsarguments.length);
  console.log(jsarguments[0], jsarguments[1]);
}
```

However I still couldn't figure out how to pass in a reference to the Symbol value generated by the middle outlet of `live.tab`:

```txt
js script-name.js              => anything() => script-name.js, <undefined>
sprintf js script-name.js %s   => anything() => no output
prepend js script-name.js      => anything() => no output
js rename-selected-track.js $1 => anything() => script-name.js, $1
js rename-selected-track.js $s => anything() => script-name.js, $s
```

#### Listeners

Patcher:

```txt
[live.tab] # UI object to listen to in script + named  (via the Scripting Name field?)

[live.button] # live.button object to send bang
  |
[js script-name.js] # js object containing script
```

JS:

```js
function bang() {
  // Run garbage collection
  gc();

  // Target object fron patcher
  const obj = this.patcher.getnamed('namedObject');

  // Assign listener
  const ml = new MaxobjListener(obj, objCallback);

  // Get the current value
  post(ml.getvalue());
}

// When the listener detects a change, fire a callback
function objCallback(data) {
  // Get the latest value
  post(data.value);
}
```

Issues:

When the object has multiple outlets, you can't choose the one with the data type you want.
For the `live.tab` object, I wanted the middle outlet (string `Symbol`) not the left outlet (`Item Index`).
The latter would have only been useful if had access to the object's `enum` so I could get the string that the index referred to.

#### Public (global) functions

As the above two techniques didn't work for me, I settled on using public functions.
This encouraged me to merge several separate scripts into one,
and then to hide helper functions using `privateFunctionName.local = 1`.

Patcher:

```txt
[live.tab] # UI object sending input to script
  | | |
    |
[functionName $1] # message object containing function to call + variable argument
    |
  [js script-name.js] # js object containing script containing function
```

JS:

```js
function functionName(arg) {
  post(arg);
}
```
